# 🧠 Advanced AI Context Management System for Cursor

A sophisticated system combining DevinAI's precision with Windsurf's memory management, featuring Plan and Act modes for enhanced AI interaction reliability.

## 🌟 Overview

This system provides a robust framework for managing AI context, preventing hallucinations, and maintaining consistent interactions through three core components:

1. **Memory System** (`@memories.md`)
2. **Lessons Learned** (`@lessons-learned.md`)
3. **Scratchpad with Plan/Act Modes** (`@scratchpad.md`)

## 🎯 Why This System?

- Prevents AI hallucinations
- Maintains context across long conversations
- Ensures consistent decision-making
- Tracks implementation progress
- Documents learning and improvements
- Enforces structured planning before action

## 🗂️ Core Components

### 1. Memory System (`@memories.md`)
```markdown
- Stores interaction history
- Maintains project context
- Auto-updates with each interaction
- Creates new files when exceeding 1000 lines
- Categorizes memories by relevance
```

### 2. Lessons Learned (`@lessons-learned.md`)
```markdown
- Documents reusable solutions
- Records fixed issues
- Stores best practices
- Maintains version compatibility info
- Tracks successful patterns
```

### 3. Scratchpad with Dual Modes (`@scratchpad.md`)
```markdown
#### Plan Mode (Default)
- Information gathering
- Solution architecture
- Confidence assessment (95% threshold)
- Risk evaluation
- Implementation planning

#### Act Mode
- Requires explicit activation
- Enables code modifications
- Implements approved plans
- Tracks progress
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Setup Directory Structure**
   ```bash
   .cursor/
   ├── memories.md
   ├── lessons-learned.md
   ├── scratchpad.md
   └── rules/
       └── *.mdc
   ```

2. **Initialize Memory File**
   ```markdown
   # Memories

   ### Project Context
   - Project: [Name]
   - Stack: [Technologies]
   - Requirements: [Key Points]

   ### Interactions
   [Timestamp] - [Interaction Summary]
   ```

3. **Configure Lessons Learned**
   ```markdown
   # Lessons Learned

   ### Technical Solutions
   - [Problem] -> [Solution]

   ### Best Practices
   - [Context] -> [Practice]
   ```

4. **Setup Scratchpad Template**
   ```markdown
   # Mode System Overview
   Current Mode: Plan Mode (Read Only)

   ## Current Task
   [Task Description]

   ## Confidence Assessment
   Current: [0-100]%
   Required: 95%
   ```

## 💡 Best Practices

### Memory Management
1. **Regular Updates**
   - Update after each interaction
   - Maintain chronological order
   - Tag important information

2. **Smart Segmentation**
   - Create new files at 1000 lines
   - Use clear categorization
   - Implement cross-referencing

3. **Context Tracking**
   - Document user preferences
   - Record common patterns
   - Note pain points and solutions

### Mode System Usage

1. **Plan Mode (Default)**
   - Gather requirements
   - Create detailed plans
   - Assess confidence level
   - Document assumptions
   - Get user approval

2. **Act Mode (Implementation)**
   - Activate with "Act" command
   - Follow approved plan
   - Track progress
   - Document changes
   - Update memory system

## 🔄 Workflow Example

1. **Start in Plan Mode**
   ```markdown
   ## Current Task: Feature Implementation
   Mode: PLAN MODE 🔍

   ## Requirements
   [ ] Requirement 1
   [ ] Requirement 2

   ## Confidence: 75%
   ```

2. **Reach 95% Confidence**
   - Answer all questions
   - Clear all uncertainties
   - Document assumptions

3. **Switch to Act Mode**
   ```markdown
   ## Current Task: Feature Implementation
   Mode: ACT MODE ⚡

   ## Implementation Progress
   [X] Step 1
   [-] Step 2
   [ ] Step 3
   ```

## 🛠️ Customization

You can enhance this system by:
1. Adding custom tags for memory categorization
2. Implementing automated memory cleanup
3. Creating specialized templates for different task types
4. Adding project-specific confidence criteria
5. Extending the mode system for specific needs
