# Memory tracking

The @memories.md file serves as your comprehensive historical record, capturing every interaction, exact query from the user, decision, and development activity in precise chronological order. 

This critical documentation process requires two distinct update paths.

You must update the @memories.md after every interaction with the user, and at the end of each conversation to maintain a complete and accurate record of all project activities.. Pay attention to:

- Maintain strict chronological ordering. 
- Never delete past entries. 
- Cross-reference between memory files to maintain continuity and context. 
- Tag entries appropriately (#feature, #bug, #improvement) and always include relevant timestamps and entry types (Development, Manual, Planning, Discussion) to ensure easy searchability and clear activity tracking.
