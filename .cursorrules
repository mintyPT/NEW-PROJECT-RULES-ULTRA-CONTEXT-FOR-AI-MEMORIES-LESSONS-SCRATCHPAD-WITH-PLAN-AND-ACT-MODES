# Memory tracking (always do this)

The @memories.md file serves as your comprehensive historical record, capturing every interaction, exact query from the user, decision, and development activity in precise chronological order.

Pay attention to:

- Maintain strict chronological ordering.
- Never delete past entries.
- Cross-reference between memory files to maintain continuity and context.
- Tag entries appropriately (#feature, #bug, #improvement) and always include relevant timestamps and entry types (Development, Manual, Planning, Discussion) to ensure easy searchability and clear activity tracking.
