*This lessons-learned file serves as a critical knowledge base for capturing and preventing mistakes. During development, document any reusable solutions, bug fixes, or important patterns using the format: [Timestamp] Category: Issue → Solution → Impact. Entries must be categorized by priority (Critical/Important/Enhancement) and include clear problem statements, solutions, prevention steps, and code examples. Only update upon user request with "lesson" trigger word. Focus on high-impact, reusable lessons that improve code quality, prevent common errors, and establish best practices. Cross-reference with @memories.md for context.*

# Lessons Learned

### Component Development
- [2024-02-08 15:30] Import Verification: When using imported components, always verify the exported members and their types first to prevent compatibility issues, as demonstrated in the TextInput and DatePicker integration where type mismatches caused errors.
- [2024-02-08 16:00] Component Extension: When extending base components (like TextInput), thoroughly check prop types and interfaces to ensure type compatibility and prevent runtime errors, particularly important for form components with complex state management.
- [2024-02-08 16:30] Date Handling: Use date-fns library for date manipulation as it provides better TypeScript support and more focused functionality, avoiding the complexity and bundle size of larger libraries like moment.js.
- [2024-02-08 17:00] Accessibility First: Implement accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation) during initial component development rather than retrofitting later, as shown in the Card and Grid components implementation.

### TypeScript Implementation
- [2024-02-08 15:45] Type Definition: When dealing with component variants, define exact string literal types instead of using string type to prevent invalid values and improve type checking, as implemented in Grid component's GridColumns type.
- [2024-02-08 16:15] Type Extension: Use proper type extensions (like Omit<>) when building upon existing HTML elements to maintain type safety while removing incompatible props, demonstrated in form component implementations.
- [2024-02-08 16:45] Component Composition: Always check prop type compatibility when composing components together, especially when dealing with forwarded refs and event handlers, as shown in Card component implementation.
- [2024-02-08 17:15] Ref Forwarding: Implement proper ref forwarding with TypeScript for reusable components to ensure proper DOM access and maintain component flexibility.

### Error Resolution
- [2024-02-08 17:30] Import Resolution: Address import errors by checking the actual exports in source files and using proper import paths, preventing issues like those encountered in the DatePicker component.
- [2024-02-08 17:45] Type Mismatch: Fix type mismatches by either adapting the component interface or updating type definitions, not by using type assertions, as demonstrated in form component fixes.
- [2024-02-08 18:00] Prop Compatibility: When encountering prop type errors, prefer removing incompatible props over forcing type assertions to maintain type safety and prevent runtime errors.
- [2024-02-08 18:15] Documentation Importance: Document component interfaces thoroughly with TSDoc comments to prevent future type-related issues and improve maintainability.

### Code Organization
- [2024-02-08 18:30] Component Grouping: Keep related components (like DatePicker and Calendar) in the same directory to maintain clear relationships and improve code navigation.
- [2024-02-08 18:45] Export Management: Use index files to manage exports and maintain clean import statements, making the codebase more maintainable and reducing import complexity.
- [2024-02-08 19:00] Utility Organization: Implement shared utilities (like useClickOutside) in a dedicated hooks directory to improve reusability and maintain clear separation of concerns.
- [2024-02-08 19:15] File Structure: Maintain consistent file structure across similar components (component file, index, README) to improve project organization and developer experience.
